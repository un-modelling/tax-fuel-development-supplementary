# Fuel_Tax_and_Development

A simulation of a fuel tax, a proxy for a carbon tax, in three developing countries show differential impacts on GDP and in a set of key social indicators. Modelling results indicate that he impacts depend not only on how the newly tax revenue is recycled back to the economy, but also on the structural features prevalent in each country. Results confirm that policy choices must be assessed on the basis of the specific characteristics and objectives of each country and that policies are not easily transferable across countries. The visualization tool displays the results of alternative policy options compared to the base line. The graphs allow for comparison across scenarios, impact variables and countries.
